# Pet_Adoption_Page
Project Description:

This is a demo pet adoption page and my first mini project in web development. The page is designed to provide information about two adorable pets that are available for adoption. It features basic details about each pet, such as their name, age, breed, and a short description to help potential adopters get to know them better.

Features:

Simple and clean layout for easy navigation.
Detailed profiles of two pets, showcasing their unique characteristics.
Basic HTML and CSS used to create an engaging and user-friendly interface.

Objective:

The main objective of this project was to practice and enhance my web development skills. It served as an introductory exercise to understand the structure of a web page, styling with CSS, and the importance of creating user-friendly content.
